### Transaction
A transaction is the atom of finance. A transaction is an exchange of currency against value delivered.

### Customer
A customer is the party who initiates the transaction. Usually, they offer currency against value delivered.

### Vendor
The vendor is the other party of the transaction. The vendor delivers value and expects currency in exchange. It is usually on the vendor to deploy the sales software to enable the exchange

### RFQ
A request for quotation is the initiation of the sales process. When the customer is not sure of the value they want from the vendor, they initiate the process with a request for quotation. This usually has items that the customer is interested in.

### Quotation
A quotation is a reply from the vendor against the RFQ. This usually happens after rounds of clarification and offline conversation between the customer and the vendor. Once the vendor is confident about the customer wants, they release the quotation.
The vendor can also release multiple quotations to give the customer options.

### Order
An order is created when the customer knows exactly what they want from the vendor.
