Building payments into an application is a process that requires (SME)Subject Matter Expertise in the domain of finance.

This is imperative to document and define the terminology, then build effective data models and interaction surfaces. There is no way that a financially inclined platforms to scale otherwise.

This project is my effort to:
1. Define and document the subject matter expertise required for payments and interactions
2. Define mock data models to see if a sensible payments infrastructure can be built out of this
3. Define a mock architecture where multiple independent products come together to build a versatile payments solution that can be served to multiple industries at large.

I am making this open source to help any platform that adopts this to the furthest extent possible.
