# Project Khaai (ขาย)
Building payments into an application is a process that requires subject matter expertise from someone in the domain of finance.

This is imperative to document and define the terminology of finance so that developers can end up building effective data models and interaction surfaces. Else, there is no way that the platforms will scale.

This project is my effort to:
1. Define and document the subject matter expertise required for payments and interactions
2. Define mock data models to see if a sensible payments infrastructure can be built out of this
3. Define a mock architecture where multiple independent products come together to build a versatile payments solution that can be served to multiple industries at large.
